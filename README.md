## Why Unit Testing?  

Unit testing is a vital part of software development. Here's why you should care:  
- **Catch Bugs Early**: Identify issues before they reach production.  
- **Improve Code Quality**: Write clean, maintainable, and robust code.  
- **Boost Confidence**: Deploy with confidence knowing your code works as intended.  
- **Simplify Refactoring**: Update your codebase without fear of breaking existing functionality.

## Learning Plan for Unit Testing in JavaScript

This plan is structured to help you learn unit testing concepts and apply them in real-world scenarios over **7 days**. Each session includes learning objectives, coding exercises, and home tasks.

---

### Day 1: Introduction to Unit Testing [Lesson](https://github.com/fix2015/unit-test-tutorial/tree/main/introduction_to_unit_testing/README.md)
- **0-5 minutes**: Understand what unit testing is and why it's important.  
- **5-15 minutes**: Learn the structure of a test: `Arrange`, `Act`, `Assert`.  
- **15-30 minutes**: Set up a basic testing environment with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).  
- **Home Task**: Write a test for a simple math utility function (e.g., `add(a, b)`).

---

### Day 2: Writing Your First Tests [Lesson](https://github.com/fix2015/writing_your_first_tests/tree/main/introduction_to_unit_testing/README.md)
- **0-5 minutes**: Review the Home Task from Day 1.  
- **5-10 minutes**: Learn how to use `describe()`, `it()`, and `expect()` in Jest.  
- **10-20 minutes**: Write tests for string manipulation functions (e.g., `capitalize()`, `reverse()`).  
- **20-30 minutes**: Discuss the importance of edge cases.  
- **Home Task**: Write tests for array utility functions (e.g., `filterEvenNumbers()`).

---

### Day 3: Mocking and Spying
- **0-5 minutes**: Review the Home Task from Day 2.  
- **5-10 minutes**: Understand what mocks and spies are and why they're useful.  
- **10-20 minutes**: Use Jest to mock a function and test API calls.  
- **20-30 minutes**: Practice spying on a functionâ€™s behavior.  
- **Home Task**: Mock a `fetch` call to test an async function.

---

### Day 4: Testing Asynchronous Code
- **0-5 minutes**: Review the Home Task from Day 3.  
- **5-10 minutes**: Learn how to test promises and async/await functions.  
- **10-20 minutes**: Write tests for an API client function.  
- **20-30 minutes**: Handle errors in asynchronous code during testing.  
- **Home Task**: Write tests for a function that interacts with an external API.

---

### Day 5: Testing React Components
- **0-5 minutes**: Review the Home Task from Day 4.  
- **5-10 minutes**: Set up React Testing Library.  
- **10-20 minutes**: Write tests for a functional React component.  
- **20-30 minutes**: Test user interactions using `fireEvent`.  
- **Home Task**: Write tests for a component with props and state.

---

### Day 6: Advanced Testing Techniques
- **0-5 minutes**: Review the Home Task from Day 5.  
- **5-10 minutes**: Learn snapshot testing with Jest.  
- **10-20 minutes**: Test performance and memory leaks in your code.  
- **20-30 minutes**: Practice testing Redux or Context API state management.  
- **Home Task**: Write advanced tests for a React component using hooks.

---

### Day 7: Real-World Project and Revision
- **0-5 minutes**: Review the Home Task from Day 6.  
- **5-10 minutes**: Revise all key concepts from the tutorial.  
- **10-20 minutes**: Implement unit tests for a real-world project (e.g., a to-do app or weather app).  
- **20-30 minutes**: Solve testing challenges on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) or [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).  
- **Final Task**: Create a testing checklist for your own projects.

## Tools and Libraries for Unit Testing

- **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)**: A powerful and popular JavaScript testing framework.  
- **[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)**: A flexible testing library for JavaScript.  
- **[Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)**: An assertion library that pairs well with Mocha.  
- **[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)**: A library for testing React components.  
- **[Sinon.js](https://sinonjs.org/)**: A library for creating spies, mocks, and stubs.

## Best Practices for Unit Testing

1. **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus on what the code does, not how it does it.  
2. **Write Small, Focused Tests**: Each test should cover one scenario or behavior.  
3. **Keep Tests Independent**: Avoid dependencies between tests to prevent side effects.  
4. **Use Meaningful Names**: Clearly describe the purpose of each test.  
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Consider boundary values, invalid inputs, and unusual scenarios.  
6. **Run Tests Regularly**: Integrate testing into your development workflow.
