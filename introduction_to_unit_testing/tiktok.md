# TikTok Video Story: Introduction to Unit Testing 🎬

---

## Scene 1: **Opening Hook** - "Why Unit Testing is a Game Changer 🚀"

**Text on screen**:  
"Want to catch bugs before they break your app? 🐞🔧"

**Narration**:  
"Unit testing is your secret weapon for building reliable software. Let’s dive into why it’s essential!"

---

## Scene 2: **What is Unit Testing?** 📏

**Text on screen**:  
"Unit testing = testing small pieces of code to make sure they work correctly! 🧪"

**Narration**:  
"Unit tests focus on testing individual functions or components to ensure they work as expected. It’s like giving your code a check-up before release!"

---

## Scene 3: **Example - Testing a Simple Function** 🖥️

**Text on screen**:  
"Let's test a simple function! ✨"

**Narration**:  
"Here’s a simple `subtract(a, b)` function. We’ll write a test to make sure it works."

**Code on screen**:  
```javascript
function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}

test('subtracts two numbers correctly', () => {
  expect(subtract(5, 3)).toBe(2);
});
```

---

## Scene 4: **Running the Test** 🏃‍♂️

**Text on screen**:  
"Run your tests and check if they pass! ✅"

**Narration**:  
"Once you write the test, you run it to make sure everything is working fine. If the test passes, you’re good to go!"

**Example on screen**:  
*Show terminal with Jest test result: "PASS"*

---

## Scene 5: **Edge Cases & Robustness** ⚖️

**Text on screen**:  
"Don’t forget to test edge cases! 🤔"

**Narration**:  
"Make sure to test edge cases—like subtracting zero or negative numbers—so your function can handle all situations."

**Example on screen**:  
```javascript
test('subtracts negative numbers correctly', () => {
  expect(subtract(-5, -3)).toBe(-2);
});
```

---

## Scene 6: **Why Unit Testing is Important?** 💡

**Text on screen**:  
"Testing = Confidence. 🚀"

**Narration**:  
"Unit tests give you confidence that your code works and prevent bugs from slipping through the cracks!"

---

## Scene 7: **Closing Call to Action** 📣

**Text on screen**:  
"Start writing tests today and level up your code! 🔥 #LearnToCode"

**Narration**:  
"Ready to start writing tests for your code? Let’s get testing and make our apps more reliable!"
