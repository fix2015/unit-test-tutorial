# TikTok Video Story: Mocking and Spying in Tests 🕵️‍♂️

---

## Scene 1: **Opening Hook** - "Ever heard of mocking in tests? 🤔"

**Text on screen**:  
"Let’s learn about mocking and spying in tests! 🕵️‍♂️"

**Narration**:  
"Today, we’re diving into how to use mocks and spies in your unit tests. Ready to level up your testing skills?"

---

## Scene 2: **What is Mocking?** 🎭

**Text on screen**:  
"Mocking = Faking parts of your code for testing. 🧪"

**Narration**:  
"Mocking allows you to fake parts of your code that are complex or outside the scope of the test, like API calls or database queries. This makes tests faster and easier!"

---

## Scene 3: **Mocking a Function** 🛠️

**Text on screen**:  
"Mock a function to test isolated behavior! 🧑‍💻"

**Narration**:  
"Let’s say we want to mock a function that fetches data from an API. Here’s how we can mock it!"

**Code on screen**:  
```javascript
// Function that fetches data
function fetchData() {
  return fetch('https://api.example.com/data').then(res => res.json());
}

// Test that mocks the fetchData function
test('mocks the fetchData function', () => {
  const mockFetchData = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data: 'test data' });
  expect(mockFetchData()).resolves.toEqual({ data: 'test data' });
});
```

## Scene 4: **What is Spying?** 👀

**Text on screen**:  
"Spying = Checking how a function was used! 🔍"

**Narration**:  
"Spying is like watching how a function behaves during a test. It allows you to check if a function was called and with what arguments."

---

## Scene 5: **Spying on a Function** 🕵️‍♀️

**Text on screen**:  
"Spy on a function to track its usage! 🎯"

**Narration**:  
"Here’s how you can spy on a function to see if it was called with the right arguments."

**Code on screen**:  
```javascript
// Function to log user info
function logUserInfo(user) {
  console.log(`${user.name} logged in.`);
}

// Test that spies on the logUserInfo function
test('spies on logUserInfo function', () => {
  const spy = jest.spyOn(console, 'log');
  logUserInfo({ name: 'Alice' });
  expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledWith('Alice logged in.');
  spy.mockRestore(); // Clean up the spy after test
});
```

## Scene 6: **Why Mocking and Spying Matter** 💡

**Text on screen**:  
"Mocking & Spying = More control in your tests! 🛠️"

**Narration**:  
"Using mocks and spies helps you control the test environment, making it easier to isolate and test specific parts of your code."

---

## Scene 7: **Closing Call to Action** 📣

**Text on screen**:  
"Start mocking and spying to make your tests more powerful! 🔥 #LearnToCode"

**Narration**:  
"Want to write more powerful and efficient tests? Get familiar with mocking and spying, and take your testing skills to the next level!"
