# Day 6: Advanced Testing Techniques ðŸ§ª

### Key Points to Address:
- Review the previous dayâ€™s home task to ensure students are comfortable with writing tests for components with props and state.  
- Introduce more advanced testing techniques like **snapshot testing**, **performance testing**, and **memory leak testing**.  
- Demonstrate how to write tests for complex state management solutions like **Redux** or **Context API**.  
- Encourage students to write tests for advanced use cases, helping them understand the depth of testing in modern React applications.

---

## 0-5 minutes: Review the Home Task from Day 5
1. **Quick recap**:
   - Ask students how they approached testing for a component with hooks and state.
   - Discuss challenges:
     - Did they test edge cases like rapidly changing state or asynchronous updates?
     - Did they test the behavior when the component re-renders?
   - Reinforce key concepts:
     - Testing components with state and props.
     - Simulating user interactions using `fireEvent()`.

---

## 5-10 minutes: Learn Snapshot Testing with Jest
1. **Introduce Snapshot Testing**:
   - "Snapshot testing helps us ensure that the rendered output of our components doesnâ€™t unexpectedly change."
   - **How it works**:
     - Jest compares the rendered output of the component with a previously saved snapshot.
     - If the output differs, Jest will notify you of the change, allowing you to decide whether itâ€™s intentional or a bug.
2. **Demonstrate Snapshot Test**:
   \`\`\`javascript
   import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
   import Greeting from './Greeting';

   test('matches the snapshot', () => {
     const { asFragment } = render(<Greeting name="Alice" />);
     expect(asFragment()).toMatchSnapshot();
   });
   \`\`\`
3. **Discuss the benefits**:
   - Snapshot tests are great for detecting unintended changes in UI.
   - They provide a quick way to catch regressions.
4. **Engage students**:
   - Ask: "What are some cases where snapshot testing might be most useful?"

## 10-20 minutes: Test Performance and Memory Leaks
1. **Explain Performance Testing**:
   - "Performance testing helps us ensure that our components render efficiently and donâ€™t cause unnecessary slowdowns."
   - Show how to measure performance with Jest and React Testing Library.
   - **Example test**:
   \`\`\`javascript
   import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
   import { act } from 'react-dom/test-utils';
   import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

   test('should render without performance issues', () => {
     const start = performance.now();
     act(() => {
       render(<MyComponent />);
     });
     const end = performance.now();
     expect(end - start).toBeLessThan(100); // Ensure rendering takes less than 100ms
   });
   \`\`\`
2. **Explain Memory Leak Testing**:
   - "Memory leaks can cause performance degradation over time. It's important to test for them, especially in large applications."
   - Show how to test for memory leaks by checking that components clean up after themselves when unmounted.
   \`\`\`javascript
   import { render, unmountComponentAtNode } from 'react-dom';
   import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

   test('should not cause memory leaks', () => {
     const div = document.createElement('div');
     render(<MyComponent />, div);
     unmountComponentAtNode(div); // Ensure no memory leaks
   });
   \`\`\`
3. **Discuss best practices**:
   - Always ensure components clean up resources when unmounted to avoid memory leaks.

## 20-30 minutes: Practice Testing Redux or Context API State Management
1. **Introduce Redux or Context API Testing**:
   - "Testing state management libraries like Redux or Context API can be more complex due to the global state and asynchronous behavior."
2. **Demonstrate Redux Test Example**:
   \`\`\`javascript
   import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
   import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
   import { createStore } from 'redux';
   import Counter from './Counter';

   const store = createStore((state = { count: 0 }) => state);

   test('renders Redux state correctly', () => {
     const { getByText } = render(
       <Provider store={store}>
         <Counter />
       </Provider>
     );
     expect(getByText(/count: 0/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
   });
   \`\`\`
3. **Encourage experimentation**:
   - Have students write tests for components connected to Redux or Context API.
   - Remind them to consider edge cases, such as when the state is empty or null.

## Home Task: Write Advanced Tests for a React Component Using Hooks
1. **Task**:
   - Write tests for a React component that uses hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, or `useReducer`.
   - Ensure to test the following:
     - Correct rendering based on initial state.
     - Proper state updates after interactions.
     - Side effects and cleanup from `useEffect`.
2. **Encourage testing edge cases**:
   - Test how the component behaves when the state changes rapidly or asynchronously.
   - Consider testing error boundaries and loading states.

---

## Closing Notes
1. **Recap the day**:
   - Highlight the importance of advanced testing techniques like snapshot testing, performance testing, and testing state management.
   - Emphasize that testing is essential for ensuring app stability and performance in production.
2. **Encourage questions**:
   - Ask students if they faced any challenges or if anything is unclear.
3. **Motivate for the home task**:
   - Remind them: "Advanced testing techniques will help you build robust applications that scale smoothly and perform efficiently."
